# Zmoon
high level compiled programming language written in C++(its compiler,lexer, parser and other parts).

# Why? 
One day (i think 31 july 2025) i started to think about there are many programming languages and the languages are mainly interpreted or compiled. Both of them have problems.
For example interpreted languages are high level but slow. It is very easy to prototype big projects in python but actually python runs it slow because of its interpreted nature.
And we have C, C++ or Java in the other side. They are compiled languages but it is very compilicated to learn cpp or java and to masterize them. It will take maybe your all career 
to write AAA game engine or game in C++ if you don't have proper understanding of optimization in C++. There my language Zmoon will come with a solution. Easy to understand and write,
easy to learn and very fast for its compiled nature.

# Notes 
At the time you read this file probably the project will be successfull. I don't try to build it as a project for only my personal affairs. There are already hundreds of programming
languages. I want to build a philosophy behind this language. Fast and easy(just what we want). I have many plans for the language and future. Thread safety like go, optimization like 
gcc compiler and all the other advanced stuff can be done by time. The language will be object-oriented high level and compiled language. It sounds similar to C++ but it will be 
one of the easiest things to learn.

# Language design 
The main concepts of design are readability, versatility and speed. I will start to release the compiler when basic arithmetic and variable storage are done in zmoon and 
the first version of compiler is ready to compile these concepts. Functions, scopes, classes and other new stuff will be added. After all the base stuff is builded GC or Concurrency will be added. 
readme, contribute will be refreshed frequently.
